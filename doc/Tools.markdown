# Tools and servers
The vitess tools and servers are designed to help you even
if you start small, and scale all the way to a complete fleet
of databases.

In the early stages, connection pooling, rowcache and other
efficiency features of vttablet help you get more from your
existing hardware.
As things scale out, the automation tools start to become handy.
